the L</Get()> and L</Set()> methods.

=head1 BASE CLASSES

Inherits from L<Kernel::Config::Defaults>.

=head1 PUBLIC INTERFACE

=head2 new()

Don't use the constructor directly, use the ObjectManager instead:

    my $ConfigObject = $Kernel::OM->Get('Kernel::Config');

=head2 Get()

Retrieves the value of a config setting.

    my $Value = $ConfigObject->Get('My::Setting::Name');

Returns the value of the setting.

=head2 Set()

Changes or deletes the value of a config setting.

    $ConfigObject->Set(
        Key   => 'My::Setting::Name',
        Value => 42,    # new value; set to undef to remove the setting
    );

=head2 ConfigChecksum()

This function returns an MD5 sum that is generated from all available
config files (F<Kernel/Config.pm>, F<Kernel/Config/Defaults.pm>, F<Kernel/Config/Files/*.(pm|xml)>
except F<ZZZAAuto.pm>) and their modification timestamps.

Whenever a file is changed, added or removed, this checksum will change.

This is used for example in the Loader to generate cache file names that change whenever
the system configuration changes.
