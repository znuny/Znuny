=head1 NAME

Sisimai::Reason - Detect the bounce reason

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sisimai::Reason;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sisimai::Reason detects the bounce reason from the content of Sisimai::Data
object as an argument of get() method. This class is called only Sisimai::Data
class.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 C<B<get(I<Sisimai::Data Object>)>>

C<get()> detects the bounce reason.

=head2 C<B<anotherone(I<Sisimai::Data object>)>>

C<anotherone()> is a method for detecting the bounce reason, it works as a fall
back method of get() and called only from get() method.

C<match()> detects the bounce reason from given text as a error message.

=head2 C<B<match(I<String>)>>

C<match()> is a method for detecting the bounce reason from the string given as
an argument of the method. However, this method is low analytical precision.

=head1 LIST OF BOUNCE REASONS

C<Sisimai::Reason->get()> detects the reason of bounce with parsing the bounced
messages. The following reasons will be set in the value of C<reason> property
of Sisimai::Data instance.

=head2 C<blocked>

This is the error that SMTP connection was rejected due to a client IP address
or a hostname, or the parameter of C<HELO/EHLO> command. This reason has added
in Sisimai 4.0.0 and does not exist in any version of bounceHammer.

    <kijitora@example.net>:

    Remote host said: 501 5.0.0 Invalid domain name

=head2 C<contenterror>

This is the error that a destination mail server has rejected email due to
header format of the email like the following. Sisimai will set C<contenterror>
to the reason of email bounce if the value of Status: field in a bounce email
is C<5.6.*>.

=item - 8 bit data in message header

=item - Too many “Received” headers

=item - Invalid MIME headers

=back

    <<< 550 5.6.9 improper use of 8-bit data in message header
    554 5.0.0 Service unavailable

=head2 C<delivered>

This is NOT AN ERROR and means the message you sent has delivered to recipients
successfully.
