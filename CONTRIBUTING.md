If you need support / assisitence with your project or just need a helping hand, get in touch:
- [Project website](https://www.znuny.org)
- [Community forum](https://community.znuny.org)
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XTud3WWZTs)
- [Commercial services](https://www.znuny.com)

The community is here to help and you can rely on them. If you need immediate help for an incident,
you can also request commercial support.

In any case, please provide as much context as you can. Please keep in mind:
the community members and the team dont know what you want to achieve or what you already tried.

## Request a Feature

If you need a new feature, feel free to follow these steps:

* Open an issue in the [featufre request repository](https://github.com/znuny/znuny-feature-requests/issues)
* Please describe your wish as detailed as possible
* Keep in mind that it should be a general feature, not one which is only for your specific usecase
* If similiar features are available, please explain why they won't work for you

After you filed the request:

* A team member will categorize and label the request
* Once a month we discuss feature requests in the team
* If a feature will be implemented it gets an "accepted" label
* If a date for the implementation is set, a version label will be added
* If a request is declined, we close the request


Please note:
We can't accept every feature request. Especially such requests that are limited to a very small fraction of the users. Our job is not only to build cool software, sometimes it requires us to say no.
Please respect that. There is always the of way of using add-ons or customizing to achieve your goal.


## Contribute Code

Before you make a code/feature contribution on your own, please ask our team in advance if this customization is likely to find a place in the project. We may have suggestions to make upfront or give you some more insights.
There is no special "checklist", just post a question and explain what you would like
to contribute. We will get in touch ASAP.
We value your time and respect your work. Thats why we dont want you to waste it on features
we might be working on in the background.


## Provide Support on Issues

We try provide support for free, as good as we can. Thats why we offer so many channels to get help, directly from
the community. We dont have a special team for Open Source support, but we do our best to support you.

The amount of free-support we can deliver is limited.

If you have a general question, the documentation, the forum and the Discord chat should be a good start.
The forum has well build search, which can help in a lot of cases. Before you open a new post, use the search.
There is a good chance that your issue was already discussed before.



## Clean Up Issues and PRs

We will close issues, which are not labeled as bug/verified/critical and haven't been updated in 30 days.
Accepted feature requests will remain open until they are implemented.
Feature requests that we won't implement, will be closed with an explanation.


## Join the Project Team

- Issue tracking and handling / labeling issues
