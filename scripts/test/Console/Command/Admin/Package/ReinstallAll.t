# Temporarily disabled to work around a mod_perl bug that occurs on Ubuntu 15.04 and gentoo atm (2016-01-29).
#
# Frontend/Basic.t finds one module to return a 500 internal error (seemingly random).
# The apache error log shows this message:
#
# [perl:error] [pid 908] [client ::1:36519] Use of each() on hash after insertion without resetting hash iterator results in undefined behavior, Perl interpreter: 0x55b01def9a90 at /opt/otrs/Kernel/cpan-lib/Apache2/Reload.pm line 171.
#
# This seems to be caused by Apache2::Reload trying to reload modules which in turn triggers an internal mod_perl bug
#   that we currently don't know.
#
# Avoid this error by not reinstalling the installed packages in the UT scenarios so that mod_perl does not try to reload the packages.

# my $CommandObject = $Kernel::OM->Get('Kernel::System::Console::Command::Admin::Package::ReinstallAll');

# my $ExitCode = $CommandObject->Execute();

# $Self->Is(
#     $ExitCode,
#     0,
#     "Admin::Package::ReinstallAll exit code",
# );
